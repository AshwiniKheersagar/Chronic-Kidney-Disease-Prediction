<h1>kidney Stone Prediction</h1>
<h5>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h5>
• Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as one of the most prominent causes of death and suffering in the 21st century. Due in part to the rise in risk factors, such as blood
pressure and diabetes mellitus, the number of patients affected by CKD has also been increasing, affecting an estimated 843.6 million individuals worldwide in 2017.

• The prevalence of CKD worldwide is 10.4% among men and 11.8% among women. AKI,experienced by 13.3 million people each year, may resolve or lead to CKD or kidney failure
in the future.

• So the prediction of kidney stone by the final output is presented using the Google colab’s default GUI in which the Chronic Kidney Disease is predicted based on the given input and the accuracy multiple and Random
forest regression is visualized.
